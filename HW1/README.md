Using tools to create Textured OBJ and GLTF files.

- ``Blender``
- gTF
- OBJ

## Description

1. Use any 3D tool to create a BOX as a **textured OBJ** file and to export as glTF
format. Texture OBJ (wavefront) file includes $*.obj$, $*.mtl$ and pictures. **glTF** is a kind color -texture model data format with additional makeup-language.
2. Please take a photo for a box (cake-box, candy-box, gift, living goods, et. al) in real-world by yourself. Import your box-photo into a 3D software. In the 3D software, please create a box, whose ratio is similar to the real object, and then attach the photo on this 3D box as a part of texture. Note: To accomplish a box, you may need at least two images.
3. Carefully assign the 3D coordinates and texture UV coordinate to each vertex of the box. And, please use image editor (ex. photoshop) to add your student-ID on the texture image, which can be seen in 3D model.
