# HW4

Create the **Tiny Planet** and **Crystal Ball** effects for a panoramic
image.

## Description

1. Write a program (javascript, python or C/C++) to read a panoramic image as the
texture of one sphere. Try to use THREE.TextureLoader() in three.js, and find the
way to render. If you can not import images, please prepare for a textured sphere
by blender and export.
2. Carefully design the geometrical relation between the camera and the sphere, and
try to simulate the “Tiny Planet” and “Crystal Ball” effects as illustrated in
commercial products of 360-degree cameras. T
3. Try to control camera or add constrains to have reasonable user experience for
users.

## Result
